## **Classification**
Based on the data in **Analysis** section, the app can be considered as __Toll Fraud__

#### **Description: Toll Fraud**
Code that tricks users into subscribing to or purchasing content via their mobile phone bill. Toll Fraud includes any type of billing except premium SMS and premium calls.  
Examples of this include direct carrier billing, wireless access point (WAP), and mobile airtime transfer. WAP fraud is one of the most prevalent types of Toll fraud. WAP fraud can include tricking users to click a button on a silently loaded, transparent WebView. Upon performing the action, a recurring subscription is initiated, and the confirmation SMS or email is often hijacked to prevent users from noticing the financial transaction.

For the app to execute __toll fraud__ functionality, the phone should be in cellular data mode and the app should have the permission (`RECEIVE_SMS` or `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER`) to read the OTP during WAP subscription

## **Analysis**
This section contains a thorough analysis of the target application. A mixture of static and dynamic analysis techniques has been performed in order to investigate the application's behavior and conclude the application as malicious.

The application is analyzed using __apktool__ and __jadx__.

### **Architecture**
The application is developed using __Java__. And the main part of the code is found under `com.wevedarkrig` after decompiling it. 

The application also has native libraries for `armeabi-v7a` and `arm64-v8`, and libraries are:
- libimg_ps.so
- libNativeImageProcessor.so
- libpanorenderer.so
- libpano_video_renderer.so
- libpl_droidsonroids_gif.so
- librsjni_androidx.so
- librsjni.so
- libRSSupport.so
- libyuv-decoder.so

### **Permissions and Capabilities**
As specified in `AndroidManifest.xml`, the application has dangerous permissions and components to perform the malicious activity

#### **Permissions**
- `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`
- `android.permission.CAMERA`
- `android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE`
- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`
- `android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER`
- `android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT`
- `android.permission.VIBRATE`
- `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`
- `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE`

#### **Capabilities**
- `android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` - class: `com.wevedarkrig.radersten.pro.vertyl.NationService`

For __toll fraud__ to execute the application simply requires `INTERNET` permission, but this app has 
- `android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` -  for changing the device to cellular data
- `android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` - for reading the otp send to the device from notifications.
